/*
Approach (Backtracking):
Start DFS with a pivot index to avoid revisiting previous elements
Begin from index 0 and explore all candidates recursively to find combinations summing to the target.

Use a path vector to track the current combination:
Add a candidate to path, subtract from target, and recursively call with the same index (allowing repeated elements).
Backtrack:
When a combination doesn't work or reaches the target, remove the last element (undo the choice) to try the next one.

Time Complexity: O(2^T)
T = target
In the worst case (like candidates = [1]), we try every possibility up to target.
Itâ€™s exponential because each number can be picked multiple times.
In more precise terms:
Let N be number of candidates and T be the target.
Time = O(N^(T/minCandidateValue))

Space Complexity: O(T)
Recursion depth can go up to T in the worst case.
path size also at most T in that scenario.
Result storage not counted in SC unless explicitly mentioned.
